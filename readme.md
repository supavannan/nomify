Uses the OMDB API to search for movies and allows your to add your favourites!

The search feature allows you to set how many results you'd like to see.
Nominated movies are added to a list of 5 favourite movies. The list is configurable to allow detailed insight into each movie where you can decide what info you'd like to display.

I have begun a feature where users can login and see their results later in time by authenticating each user via Google OAuth and storing the nomination lists in mongoDB but have run out of time for now.
